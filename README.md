# The locally Gaussian partial correlation

This is the public repository for the paper *The locally Gaussian partial correlation* by Håkon Otneim and Dag Tjøstheim, published in the Journal of Business and Economic statistics in 2021. In addition to the supplementary material that accompanies the article, this repository also contains replication code for the power experiment that is presented in the paper. Be adviced, however, that this will probably take months to replicate on a standard 2021 desktop computer.

Unfortunately, the script file that accompanies the journal paper does not contain replication code for Figures 3 and 4. This code is included in the file `rcode_and_data/rcode_correct.R`.
